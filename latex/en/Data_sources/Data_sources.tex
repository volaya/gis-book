\chapter{Geographical data sources}

\pagestyle{fancy}

Not so long ago, all information used in a GIS came had its origin in a paper map, which was \emph{prepared} to adapt to the particular nature of that GIS. Geogrpahical data were obtained from the \textbf{digitalization} of printed cartography, that is, from the conversion of analogic maps into digital data that a GIS can handle.

Apart from the fact that we can use them in a GIS, digital data have many advantages and represent an important qualitative imrpovement. Digital data are easier to update, easier to distribute (specially since the Internet was created), use less physical space and are easier to maintain (digital data do not degrade. Their physical support does, but they are easy to replicate without losing their quality).

Techniques for gepgraphical data aquisition have evolved, and can now create data that can be directly integrated into a GIS. Data sources that produce data ready for being used in a GIS are called \textbf{primary} data sources. Those that generate data that has to be adapted or converted are called \textbf{secondary} data sources.

In this chapter, we will see the main data sources that provide data for GIS.

\section{Remote sensing}

Remote sensing is the \textbf{acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with it}. Instead of measuring the object itself, it measures the perturbations ---mainly the electromagnetic ones--- that it causes on its surroundings. In our case, it is applied to objects on the Earth's surface.

A remote sensing system contains the following elements (Figure \ref{Fig:Elements_remote_sensing}):

\label{Fig:Elements_remote_sensing} 
\end{figure}


\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{A source of radiation (A)}. It can be natural or artificial. Radiation emitted by the source reaches the Earth's surface and is altered by the presence of the objects on that surface. Remote sensing studies that alteration. Objects themselves can emit radiation as well.
	\item \textbf{Objects (B) that interact with radiation} or can emit it, as mentioned above.
	\item \textbf{An atmosphere (C)} through which radiation moves from the source to the objects. The atmosphere also interacts with the radiation and alters it.
	\item \textbf{A receiver (D) which receives the radiation} once that has been emited or altered by the objects. The receptor measures the intensity of the radiation coming from differnt points in the area being studied, and with them generates its final product (in most cases, and image). 
\end{itemize}

In this chapter, we will describe these elements in detail. To study the two first, we will also study some fundamentals about radiation and its interaction with matter. For describing the receivers take make part of a remote sensing system, we will separate them into two components: sensors and platforms.

Interaction with the atmosphere is interesting in order to eliminate its influence, since in most cases we are interested in the object on the Earth's surface, not the atmosphere itself. Removing that influence is part of the post-processing of the data. Those processes are, however, rather complex, and they will not be explained here.


\subsection{Electromagnetic radiation}

Electromagnetic radiation is caused by alterations in the electric and magnetic fields, which generate waves corresponding to each one of the. This waves move at the speed of light and can be described with the usual parameters such as wavelength and frequency. The range of frequencies (and corresponding wavelengths) of electromagnetic radiation is calle the \textbf{electromagnetic spectrum}

The spectrum is subdivided in regions depending on the wavelength, such as (for shorter to larger wavelength) gamma rays, X rays, ultraviolet region, visible region, infrared region or microwaves.


Radiation emited by a radiation source is altered by the presence of objects that \textbf{absorb, transmit} or \textbf{reflect} it.

These three phenomena take place in a different proportion depending on the characteristics of the object and the radiation. For remote sensing, \textbf{the interesting part fis the one that is reflected}, since it is the one that can be collected later and used to produce the data output.

Since each object reflects radiation at different wavelengths in a different way, this can be considered as a property of an object. The particular response of a given object and the way it alters a given radiation (which depends on its shape, material, etc.) is known as its \textbf{spectral signature} and can be used to identify the object.


\subsection{Sensors and platforms}

The two main technological elemtns in a remote sensing system, both of them related to the receiver are the \textbf{sensor} and the \textbf{platform}.

The sensor is the element that can <<read>> the electromagnetic radiation and register its intensity for a given zone of the spectrum. It can be a simple photographic camera or a more specialized sensor.

\textbf{Passive} sensors use natural source of radiation (in most cases, sunlight), and just measure that radiation as it is reflected on the Earth's surface. \textbf{Active} sensors emit their own radiation, and then collect it back after it has been reflected. Here is a simple example to better understandthis: a photographic camera as a passive sensor, while a photographic camera that uses a flash unit is an active one. The radiation emitted by an active sensor does not have to be visible light (as in the case of the flash); the sensor can emit in other parts of the spectrum.

Technologies such as \textbf{radar} or \textbf{LiDAR} (similar to radar but with light pulses instead of radio waves) are based on active sensors.

The sensor is \textbf{mounted on a platform}, and it perfoms its data acquisition from it. \textbf{Several sensors} can be mounted on a single platform.

The two main types of platforms are those located inside the Earth's atmosphere (mostly on airplanes) and those outside of it (on satellites).

The advantage of airplanes is their \textbf{availability}, since they can be piloted and used to cover any place on earth at any moment. Satellites, on the other hand, cannot be guided, and its movement is fixed and defined by a set of parameters known as \textbf{orbital parameters}, which define the orbit described by the satellite around the Earth.

Orbits can be classified according to their \textbf{rotation axis} or their \textbf{movement}. Two particular cases are the \textbf{geosynchronous} orbits (the satellite is located in a fixed point and its movement follows the earth rotation) and the \textbf{heliosynchronous} (the satellite passes over any given point in its path always at the same local solar time).
	
\subsubsection{Resolutions}

One of the most important parameters that define the characteristics of a remote sensing system are its \textbf{resolutions}. These define the level of detail of the products that it creates. Resolutions depend on both the sensor and the platform as an single operative unit, and on the individual characteristics of each of them. Four resolutions can be defined:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Spatial resolution}. It indicates the size of the smaller object that can be distinguished. If the output is an image, the spatial resolution is the real size of the area represented by a single pixels.
	\item \textbf{Spectral resolution}. It indicates the amplitude of each of the regions of the spectrum that is registerd. It is defined by the total amplitude that is covered and the number of sections into which it is divided. The measurement corresponding to each of these sections will usually be stored in a separate band in the resulting image. 
	\item \textbf{Radiometric resolution}. It indicates the level of detail of the intensity measurement taken for each of the spectral regions that are registered. 
	\item \textbf{Temporal resolution}. It indicates the time that it takes the sensor to return to a given place. It makes sense only for orbital sensors. It depends on the platform characteristics, such as its attitude, and also on the sensor characteristics.
\end{itemize}

It is not possible (for technical or theoretical reasons) to have a sensor in which all the above resolutions are high. Some sensor might favor cetain resolutions, while other might favor different ones.

When using images coming from remote sensing in a GIS, we should consider which resolution is more important (for instance, to locate elements that have a small size, high spatial resolution is needed). Using data from several different sensors is a good strategy for overcoming these limitations.


\subsection{Photogrammetry}

Photogrammetry is the technique used to study and precisely define the shape, size and position in space of any object, using measurements taken on one or several photographs. Of special interest to GIS is the branch of photogrametry known as \textbf{aerial photogrammetry}, which uses aerial photographs and it is mainly used for generating elevation data through a process known as \textbf{restitution}.

Instead of single images, the branch of photogrammery known as \textbf{stereophotogrammetry} uses pairs of images, each of them taken from a different point. These images form a \textbf{stereo pair} and with them a three-dimensional reconstruction of the original scene can be produced. This can be used by an operator to <<see>> the scene with \textbf{depth and volume}, and using that, terrain forms can be identified and elevation information can be obtained. 

If using satellite images, stereo pairs can be obtained from those platforms and sensors that allow \textbf{changing the angle of vision}, so in the same satellite pass pictures of a given area can be taken from different points.

Photogrammetry can be \textbf{analogic} or \textbf{digital}, the latter being the one more related to the field of GIS.

Stereoplotters are used to combine and align the images that form the stereo pair. Current stereoplotters are called \emph{analytical stereoplotters}  contain elements from GIS, along with more specific ones. Among these, we find specific visualization software and peripherals such as 3D mouses or other mechanical elements found in analogic photogrammetric devices, making it easy for operators to adapt to this new type of tools.

\section{Printed cartography. Digization}

A large amount of cartography exists in printed form, such as maps or old analogic aerial photographs. To be used in a GIS, this cartography has to be \textbf{digitized}. That means creating raster or vector layers from them. In this last case, it also implies \textbf{separating the different types of information} that the map might contain, since printed maps information that, in a GIS, would be stored in independent layers.


Digitizing a printed cartographic document involves three steps: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Georeferencing} the original document. That is, setting a geogrpahical context (coordinate system, control points, etc.), so the digitized element that we will produce are correctly referenced.
\item \textbf{Digitizing the spatial component}. That is creating the corresponding geometries.
\item \textbf{Digitizing the thematic component}. Creating cell values for raster layer or attributes in the case of vector ones.

Digitazion can be \textbf{manual} or \textbf{automatic}. In the first case, an operator introduces the value, while in the second one that is an done by an algorithm.

To create raster layers, the most common method is to \textbf{scan} the original document using a \textbf{scanner}, which creates a digital image from an analogic one.

There are hihg-end scanners specifically designed for woking with cartographic documents. Generic scanners, however, can be used for this task with acceptable result in terms of accuracy and distortion. 

Two parameters define the characteristics of a scanner: its \textbf{spatial resolution} and its \textbf{radiometric resolution}. The first one is usually measured in \textbf{dots per inch} (DPI) and indicates the number of points (cells) that the sensor will create in the resulting image for each length unit in the original document. Radiometric resolution defines the ability of the sensor to separate between to different colors.

The ideas discussed in chapter \ref{Fundamentals} about scale should be taken into account here as well. Working with a higuer resolution (if the scanner allows it) will not always mean adding more information to the resulting image, since it might not exist in the original document. We would just have a larger volume of data than the one needed to capture all the information in the printed document, but not more information.

In the case of vector layers, \textbf{manual digitazion} is the most common method. An operator defines the features, tracing its geometries and entering the associated attribute data.

To digitize geometries, the operator can use the \textbf{editing functionality of a GIS} and work on the screen of the computer using its mouse as tracing device, or use specialized peripheral such as a \textbf{digitizing tablet}. In the first case, digitizing takes places on the screen, so a digital version of the printed document is needed (although not a vector one), which can be obtained by scanning it. The full digitazion process is, therefore, a two-step one, which includes two different types of digitazion: from printed map to raster image (automatic), and from image to vector features (manual). If using a tablet, the printed map can be used directly to trace geometries on it.

Automatic digitazation of geometries in a vector layer is known as \textbf{vectorization}. A digital image is needed, so the original document has to be scanned first. The vectorization algorithm analyzes the map and finds the elements that it contains, creating the corresponding vector layer elements from that. Manual work is usually needed to complete and correct the resulting data, since this tends to be a complex and error-prone process in which data preparation has a great importance, and a fully automatic alternative is not possible most of the time.

A particular case of digitazion is the \textbf{creation of layers from values representing some spatial process}. That is, when the original analogic document is not a map, but just a set of values. This process is known as \textbf{geocoding}, and it involves assigning coordinates to those values, and then creating the corresponding layers with the combination of the original thematic data and the geographical information (the spatial component) that resulted from the geocoding process.

The original alphanumeric data can be introduced manually or using an automated approach, such as scanning the document and then using some character recognition (OCR) software.

A particular and very popular case of geocoding (although in this case the document is not analogic) is \textbf{geotagging}, in which coordinates are assigned to digital images.


\subsection{Quality of digitization}

One of the most important aspects of digitazion is the \textbf{quality of its result}, which should be as close as possible to the quality of the document being digitized. Digitazion is never perfect, regardless of the accuracy of the equipment that is used or the skills or the person that performs it. There will always be errors and deficiencies.


Además de los errores que puedan incorporarse en las distintas fases del proceso de digitalización (sea este del tipo que sea), hay que considerar que las fuentes originales a digitalizar también pueden incluir los suyos propios. Así, el proceso de escaneado puede incorporar distorsiones geométricas, pero es posible que el mapa o fotografía aérea de partida también presente alguna distorsión como consecuencia de su deterioro, más patente cuanto más antigua sea esta. 

La información contenida en el documento cartográfico puede también contener elementos problemáticos de cara a obtener un producto de calidad, que pueden ir desde líneas borradas total o parcialmente a manchas en el propio mapa derivadas de su uso habitual.

Dentro de los errores que aparecen como consecuencia de la digitalización en sí, un tipo importante de ellos son las \textbf{discrepancias y coincidencias imperfectas} entre las distintas entidades, tal como las que se muestran en la figura \ref{Fig:Imprecisiones_digitalizacion}

\begin{figure}[!hbt]   
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Data_sources/Imprecisiones_digitalizacion.pdf}
\caption{\small Errores derivados del proceso de digitalización. a) Versión correcta, con nodos coincidentes. b) y c) Versiones con errores que causan una falsa desconexión entre las líneas.}
\label{Fig:Imprecisiones_digitalizacion} 
\end{figure}


Debido a esto, las capacidades de edición de los SIG incorporan funcionalidades que permiten evitar estos errores en el momento de la digitalización, ayudando al operario en su tarea y permitiéndole alcanzar una exactitud y precisión imposible de lograr sin estas funcionalidades. Entre ellas, es especialmente importante el establecimiento de tolerancias y ajuste automático en función de ellas (esto se conoce con el término ingles \textbf{snapping}), que ayudan a garantizar la coincidencia entre los distintos vértices. 


El hecho de que exista una completa coincidencia es especialmente importante cuando la capa vectorial que se digitaliza contiene \textbf{información topológica}. La topología exige que la coincidencia sea correcta y defina perfectamente la relación entre las entidades. La digitalización de entidades, en caso de querer recoger su topología, debe realizarse siguiendo reglas adicionales tales como la digitalización una única vez de los lados comunes de polígonos. Debe, asimismo, recoger información adicional, como por ejemplo la necesaria para la definición de nodos en los cruces entre líneas cuando existe relación entre estas.


\section{GPS}

Uno de los hitos en la aparición de nuevas fuentes de datos geográficos es la aparición de los \textbf{Sistemas Globales de Navegación por Satélite}. Se trata de sistemas que permiten \textbf{conocer en todo momento y en cualquier punto del globo la localización exacta de dicho punto} con un margen de error del orden de unos pocos metros o menos. Para ello, se basan en el envío de señales entre un dispositivo situado en el punto concreto y una red de satélites, pudiendo establecerse la posición exacta mediante las características de dicha transmisión.

El ejemplo más extendido de estos sistemas es el \textbf{Sistema de Posicionamiento Global} (Global Positioning System, o \textbf{GPS}). El GPS cuenta con una constelacion de 24 satélites activos, así como estaciones terrestres que los controlan, y su funcionamiento se basa en la \textbf{triangulación de la posición} de una unidad receptora, mediante las señales procedentes de un cierto número de satélites. Esta triangulación se basa en distancias entre la unidad receptora y dichos satelites, las cuales se calculan mediante diversos mecanismos. La posición se calcula no únicamente en sus coordenadas \emph{x} e \emph{y}, sino también en \emph{z}, es decir en elevación. El sistema GPS emplea como sistema geodésico de referencia el WGS84.


El diseño de la red de satélites está pensado para garantizar que en cualquier punto de la superficie terrestre y en cualquier momento, un receptor puede localizar el número necesario de satélites para obtener con exactitud su precisión. 

Existen \textbf{numerosas fuentes de error} que causa desviaciones apreciables en el calculo de coordenadas mediante GPS. Entre ellas destacan los errores en la posición de los satélites, errores por el rebote de la señal en otros con anterioridad a alcanzar el receptor, errores por el paso de la señal por la atmósfera, así como los de precisión de los relojes empleados para el cálculo de distancias. La \textbf{disponibilidad selectiva} era un error aleatorio introducido en la señal GPS con fines militares, pero fue eliminada en el año 2000.

Entre las técnicas empleadas para corregir estas desviaciones, destaca el denominado \textbf{GPS diferencial}, pensado en origen para eliminar el error de la disponibilidad selectiva, aunque también eficaz para corregir una buena parte los restantes errores citados anteriormente.

Para la aplicación del GPS diferencial se requiere no solo un receptor único (aquel del cual se quiere calcular su posición), sino también otro \textbf{receptor fijo} de referencia cuyas coordenadas se conocen con alta precisión. Este receptor fijo es, a su vez, un receptor de alta precisión y, además de calcular su propia posición, emite información que las unidades receptoras pueden aprovechar para corregir sus mediciones. El receptor móvil, lógicamente, tiene que estar capacitado para este tipo de correcciones, para así poder hacer uso de la señal de la estación de referencia.

El fundamento de esta técnica es que los errores que afectan al receptor móvil \textbf{también afectan al de referencia}. No obstante, la magnitud del error que afecta al receptor de referencia puede conocerse, ya que se conoce la coordenada exacta de este, y en base a eso puede eliminarse el error que afecta al receptor móvil, asumiendo que ambos errores son de similar índole.

En la actualidad, aplicando estas técnicas de corrección diferencial, un GPS puede obtener precisiones del orden de 2 metros en latitud y longitud, y 3 en altitud. Sin corrección diferencial, esta precisión es de unos 10--20 metros.

La precisión del sistema GPS depende del tipo de receptor GPS (o, en el lenguaje común, GPS a secas) que se emplee, obteniéndose mayores precisiones con receptores más avanzados, siempre dentro de las posibilidades del propio sistema GPS. Existen muchas clases de receptores GPS, siendo dos de ellas las principales en relación con los SIG:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{GPS para uso general}. Unidades \textbf{pequeñas y portátiles}, de bajo coste, para actividades al aire libre, donde no se requiere una precisión elevada sino simplemente un conocimiento de la posición aproximada. Se emplean, por ejemplo, para recoger rutas en senderismo o navegación. 
	\item \textbf{GPS para la medición topográfica}. Unidades de medio tamaño, generalmente con una antena independiente que se conecta a la unidad y que el propio operario carga a la espalda. La antena garantiza \textbf{mayor precisión} y una mejor localización de satélites en condiciones tales como zonas bajo arbolado. Están pensados para un uso profesional en levantamientos o replanteos, ofreciendo buena precisión en todas las coordenadas. 
	
\end{itemize}	


La capacidad principal de una unidad GPS en relación con un SIG es la de \textbf{recoger coordenadas}. Esta funcionalidad permite almacenar puntos o trazados completos, encontrándose el operario inmóvil o bien en movimiento a lo largo de dicho trazado. Es habitual utilizar los vocablos ingleses de la terminología GPS para denotar los distintos elementos que pueden recogerse, conociéndose a un punto de interés aislado como \textbf{waypoint} y un trazado como \textbf{track}. Una serie ordenada de \emph{waypoints} se conoce como \textbf{route} (ruta).

En el trabajo con el receptor GPS, el operario se puede detener en un punto cualquiera y memorizar las coordenadas del mismo, añadiendo así un \emph{waypoint} a la lista de los ya almacenados. Para crear un trazado, se suele disponer de funcionalidades de recogida automática de puntos, de tal modo que el receptor memoriza estos a intervalos fijos de tiempo. El operario simplemente ha de desplazarse por el trazado y dejar que el receptor haga su trabajo mientras tanto. 


\section{Información Geográfica Voluntaria}

Hemos mencionado ya que los dispositivos tales como receptores GPS de bajo coste pueden emplearse para recoger información geográfica y crear datos geográficos, y que cuando esto se une a los conceptos participativos de la denominada \textbf{Web 2.0}, surgen iniciativas de gran interés en las que el usuario de a pie, sin necesidad de una formación específica como cartógrafo, puede aportar sus datos para que otros los exploten posteriormente. Aunque no se trata de una fuente de datos como tal, y los elementos y dispositivos empleados ya los hemos visto a lo largo de este capítulo, el cambio que supone la inclusión de una filosofía acorde con las ideas de la Web 2.0 es tan notable que merece ser tratado por separado. No se trata de un cambio en la propia toma o preparación de datos, o de una tecnología nueva que se aplique a estos, sino de un \textbf{cambio social y filosófico} que redefine el propio concepto de la información geográfica en lo que a la creación del dato geográfico respecta, y cuyas consecuencias son ciertamente importantes, ya que abren el ámbito de la creación cartográfica a un nuevo y amplio grupo de personas.

Se conoce como \emph{Información Geográfica Voluntaria o Participativa} (en inglés, Volunteered Geographical Information, VGI) al uso de Internet para crear, gestionar y difundir información geográfica aportada voluntariamente por usuarios de la propia red. El conjunto de herramientas y técnicas que emplean esos usuarios para aportar su información conforma lo que se ha dado en llamar \textbf{neogeografía}. La comparación entre proyectos de creación de VGI y la bien conocida Wikipedia sirve perfectamente para ilustrar qué es lo que entendemos por VGI y neogeografía, ya que la VGI es el resultado de aplicar los conceptos de la Web 2.0 al ámbito de la información geográfica. 

En el caso particular de esta última, la neogeografía ha supuesto un profundo cambio en algunas de las ideas básicas de la cartografía, modificando asimismo la concepción tradicional de la información geográfica, sus características o el papel que esta venía desempeñando en muchos ámbitos (o incluso dándole un papel en campos donde con anterioridad el uso de información geográfica era escaso). Algunas de las ideas principales sobre la neogeografía son las siguientes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Popularización y democratización}. La producción cartográfica ha estado siempre en manos de gobiernos u organismos, y en muchas ocasiones fuertemente censurada debido a su elevado valor estratégico. Con la VGI, la creación de información geográfica se democratiza y se convierte en un proceso participativo libre y sin restricciones.  Se invierte el esquema <<hacia abajo>> de producción y uso de información geográfica.
	\item Los ciudadanos se convierten en \textbf{sensores} y tienen mayor consciencia de su realidad geo--espacial.
	\item Se elimina parte del <<misticismo>> de la producción de información geográfica	
\end{itemize}

En la actualidad, el proyecto de VGI de mayor relevancia es \textbf{OpenStreetMap} (OSM), un <<proyecto colaborativo para crear mapas libres y editables>>.


\section{Metadatos}

Con independencia de la forma en que se hayan obtenido, los datos pueden requerir otros datos adicionales para interpretarse. Por ejemplo, si tenemos las coordenadas de un punto, para interpretarlo correctamente necesitamos conocer, entre otras cosas, el sistema de coordenadas en que vienen expresadas esas coordenadas. El dato con el que trabajamos (las coordenadas), requiere unos datos adicionales (por ejemplo, el código EPSG del sistema de referencia empleado) para cobrar verdadero sentido.

Surge así el concepto de \textbf{metadatos}. Los metadatos son \textbf{datos acerca de los datos}, y su misión es \textbf{explicar el significado de los datos}. Es decir, ayudan a los usuarios de los datos a entender mejor el significado que estos tienen y la información que guardan. Los metadatos son un documento adicional que acompaña a los datos, y que permite una mejor gestión y una utilización más precisa de ellos.

Trabajando en el entorno de un SIG, los metadatos se \textbf{asocian a una capa y a su contenido}, y pueden \textbf{referirse a ambas componentes} (temática y espacial)


El concepto de metadato no es algo nuevo y exclusivo de los datos digitales, ya que un mapa impreso también contiene metadatos en cierta forma. Una leyenda o un texto en un margen del mapa con información sobre la fecha en que se ha creado son también metadatos. En el caso de los datos geográficos digitales, los metadatos no forman parte del dato directamente sino que \textbf{son independientes de este}. Ello permitirá \textbf{realizar operaciones separadamente con los metadatos}, tales como búsquedas, que abren nuevas posibilidades y dan un gran valor a estos.

Dos de las funciones principales de los metadatos son \textbf{garantizar el uso correcto de los datos y facilitar su gestión, localización y consulta}.

Los datos espaciales, como muchos otros datos, son creados habitualmente para un determinado objetivo, y este objetivo no ha de ser necesariamente evidente o contenerse como tal en los datos mismos. Cuando se emplean esos datos para un objetivo distinto a aquel para el que fueron diseñados, pueden surgir problemas debido a que se está realizando un proceso para el que los datos con los que se trabaja presentan carencias.  Por ejemplo, consultar los metadatos puede \textbf{evitar el trabajo con datos desfasados o de precisión insuficiente}, ya que conociendo estos parámetros es posible juzgar si los datos son adecuados al fin que se persigue con ellos.

Los creadores de datos deben procurar \textbf{acompañarlos de metadatos precisos y suficientes}, y los usuarios deben \textbf{consultarlos antes de utilizar} dichos datos. 

Respecto a la gestion de los datos, los metadatos facilitan la organización y la realización de tareas tales como la busqueda de datos dentro de una colección de estos. Los metadatos constituyen un <<resumen>> de las características principales de los datos, y pueden ser empleados para labores de búsqueda y localización de datos de un tipo dado. Los metadatos \textbf{facilitan y agilizan la localización} de los datos cuando estos se buscan \textbf{por criterios geográficos}. Añadiendo a los metadatos elementos como la extensión del área cubierta por los datos, este tipo de búsquedas se efectúan de forma más ágil y efectiva. En este sentido, el uso de metadatos es fundamental para el establecimiento de \textbf{catalogos de datos}, los cuales ya que responden a las peticiones del usuario del catálogo en función de la información que los metadatos contienen.


\subsection{Contenido y creación de metadatos}

La información que contienen los metadatos para una capa de datos espaciales depende de factores tales como el \textbf{modelo de representación} empleado, el \textbf{formato} en que se almacenan los datos (formato de archivo, base de datos, etc.), la \textbf{organización, entidad o individuo responsable} o el \textbf{elemento al que se asocian} (conjunto de capas, capa individual, entidad\ldots).
 
 
Algunos de los elementos comunes que se incorporan a los metadatos geográficos son la información \textbf{de identificación} (para identificarlo de forma única y distinguirlo de otros), la información \textbf{sobre la calidad de los datos} (incluyendo su origen y el de los datos de los que deriva, apareciendo asi el concepto de \textbf{linaje} de los datos), la información \textbf{sobre la componente no espacial} o la información \textbf{sobre la distribución} (acceso, licencias, etc.)

Los metadatos puede \textbf{crearse en el origen} mismo de los datos, recogiendo la información al mismo tiempo que se producen los datos en sí. Tambien pueden \textbf{extenderse posteriormente} por parte de distribuidores, organizadores o usuarios.

La creación de los metadatos se realiza en su mayor parte \textbf{de forma manual}, existiendo aplicaciones específicas para ello. Los metadatos que pueden extraerse de las capas de datos directamente, tales como la extension cubierta por estos, pueden crearse de forma automática.

Los metadatos se almacenan en general como \textbf{ficheros adicionales} a los ficheros de datos, o bien como \textbf{parte de una base de datos}.
